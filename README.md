# WebBrowser
This is a web browser that I have been working on, there could possibly be an iPhone version coming soon.
Download the *KFLWeb.zip* file to use the browser.
*There is no history collected on this app and you can add favorites to it if desired.*
*There will be updates to this app weekly or daily depending on my homework schedule.*
*I will try to implement proxies and more secure features to it. If you would like to contribute to this project let me know. Just be aware that my code is not the best*
*Enjoy*
